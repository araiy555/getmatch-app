# ![](docs/assets/postmill-128.png) Postmill

**Postmill** is a free, web-based, social link aggregator with voting and
threaded comments. It is built on the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework.
Any similarities between this software and that of a large community symbolised
by an alien logo are purely coincidental.

## Getting started

[Read the documentation][wiki] in the wiki.

## Support

We have a [Matrix channel][matrix] where you can ask for help and support.

## Reporting issues

* Bugs and suggestions on how to improve existing functionality should be
  reported on the [issue tracker][issues].
* Feature requests are no longer acceptable on the issue tracker--I will not do
  free work for you.
* Support questions do not belong on the issue tracker. Use the aforementioned
  public support channels.

## Contributions

You are always welcome to submit merge requests for bug fixes, improvements,
documentation, translations, and so on.

If you want to contribute a new feature, you should start an issue on the issue
tracker to gauge the possibility of it being merged. A feature that's outside
the scope of the software is likely to be rejected. We don't want hurt feelings,
so please just ask beforehand.

## Donations

Instead of donating to me, consider [donating to help trans people cover living
expenses][#transcrowdfund].

<!-- But if you absolutely must donate to me, send bitcoins to
1AXAH2ZaHfVsq2xnbXRN9497FpUAri8x72. I'll probably spend them eventually. -->

## Contact

You can email emma1312@protonmail.ch to discuss something in private with the
creator of the software. **Do not email me for asking for support**--use the
public support channels instead.

## License

The software is released under the zlib license. See the `LICENSE` file for
details.
